# Uncommon HTML DOM Access Error
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can occur when accessing elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) before they've been fully rendered and added to the page.  The error arises from attempting to manipulate a DOM element before it exists, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The primary issue is accessing and modifying a DOM element (`myDiv`) before it's been added to the page's structure.  This will frequently cause a JavaScript error and prevent further interactions with the element.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the element exists in the DOM *before* attempting to manipulate it.  This can be achieved by using DOMContentLoaded event, placing the script at the bottom of the `<body>` tag, or using `setTimeout` to allow the browser time to render the element.
